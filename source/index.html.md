# Introduction

Welcome to the Fiwit API! You can use our API to access Fiwit API endpoints, which can get information on assets, tickets, and other elements from the Fiwit application.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

> Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key.

Fiwit uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Fiwit API key in [your user settings](https://www.fiwit.io/settings).

Fiwit expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

Moreover, in all your requests, you should indicate that you expect to receive JSON 
data using the `Accept: application/json` header. 

# Assets

Assets represent any element constituting your IT : server, database, software, phone, â€¦

## List all assets

To list the assets, just issue a `GET` request to the `/assets` endpoint


```shell
# Request
curl "https://www.fiwit.io/assets" \
  -H "Authorization: API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
  
# Sample response
[
    {
        "id": 127,
        "name": "Laptop BERK42",
        "user_id": 85,
        "created_at": "2020-04-01T05:45:23.469Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-04-01T05:45:33.592Z",
        "assigned_id": null,
        "location_id": null,
        "asset_type_id": 362,
        "team_id": 111,

        }
    ]
}
```

## Create an asset

To create an asset, issue a `POST` request to the `/assets`endpoint. 


```shell

curl "https://www.fiwit.io/assets/" \
  -H "Authorization: API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
